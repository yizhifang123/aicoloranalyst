## Overview
The **Fashion Palette Outfit Generator** is a web application that extracts a color palette from an uploaded image and generates fashion outfit suggestions based on the extracted colors and the selected season. The tool helps users visualize how to incorporate their favorite colors into stylish, season-appropriate outfits.

## Features
1. **Color Extraction**: Upload an image to extract its dominant color and an 8-color palette.
2. **Seasonal Outfit Suggestions**: Get AI-generated outfit ideas tailored to the current season (spring, summer, fall, or winter).
3. **Fallback Suggestions**: If the AI API fails, the app provides pre-defined fallback outfit suggestions.
4. **Responsive Design**: Works on both desktop and mobile devices.

## How It Works
1. **Upload an Image**: Users upload an image (e.g., a favorite outfit, artwork, or scenery).
2. **Extract Colors**: The app uses the [Color Thief](https://github.com/lokesh/color-thief) library to extract the dominant color and an 8-color palette from the image.
3. **Select a Season**: Users choose the season for which they want outfit suggestions.
4. **Generate Outfits**: The app sends the color palette and season to the OpenAI API (or uses fallback suggestions) to generate outfit ideas.
5. **Display Results**: Outfit suggestions are displayed in a user-friendly format, including tops, bottoms, accessories, and shoes.
